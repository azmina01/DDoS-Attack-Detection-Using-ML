# DDoS-Attack-Detection-Using-ML
In the domain of network security, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) assault is one of the most harmful. DDoS attacks prevent vital services from operating normally for many online applications. DDoS-affected systems continue to be busy with erroneous requests rather than provide services to actual users. Attacks like these are becoming more frequent and sophisticated every day. As a result, it is now challenging to identify these assaults and protect online services from them. In this study, we applied a machine learning-based methodology to identify and categorize the traffic as either normal or DoS. The balanced and upgraded CICDDoS2019 dataset, which contains a mixture of various contemporary forms of assaults and regular traffic, is used to validate the suggested technique. The attacks are categorized using a Google Colab machine learning tool that is available online. The performance of the Logistic Regression Classifier will be compared with that of K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest in this study. Oversampling and undersampling will be used to address the class imbalance in the dataset. In addition, hyperparameter adjustment will be used to enhance the performance of the classifying models.
